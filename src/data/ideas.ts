      "This cloud was one of the first projects I made and I absolutely love how simple and cute it is!(I named him Todd) It was a pretty simple project as it had no sewing or yarn changes and was worth every stitch as now he’s made his home on my bookshelf. I followed a video tutorial on Youtube but sadly don’t know which because of how long it's been since I used it",

      "My most recent project getting back into the crochet world was this simple mesh bag. It was once again a beginner-friendly project but that doesn’t undermine its value at all. It’s pretty and functional, everything necessary. I’ll link the video I followed below.",
